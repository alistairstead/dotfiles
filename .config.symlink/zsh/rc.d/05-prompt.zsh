#      %F{<x>}:  Set foreground color. <x> can be one of the 8 standard color
#                names, a number from 0 to 255 or a hex value (if your terminal
#                supports it). See also
#                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors
#           %f:  Reset foreground color to default.
#           %~:  Current directory, in ~abbreviated form
#           %#:  If user is root, then '#', else '%'
# %(?,<a>,<b>):  If last exit status was 0, then <a>, else <b>

# Strings in "double quotes" are what is in some languages called "template
# strings": They allow the use of $expansions inside, which are then
# substituted with the parameters' values.
# Strings in 'single quotes', on the other hand, are literal strings. They
# always evaluate to the literal characters you see on your screen.


# Lazy-load our chpwd() and precmd() hook functions from file.

# -U tells autoload not to expand aliases inside the function.
# -z tells autoload that the function file is written in the default Zsh style.
# The latter is normally not necessary, but better safe than sorry.

# We can autoload these functions by just their name, rather than by path,
# because in 04-env.zsh, we added their parent dir to our $fpath.

# Continuation prompt
#
# This prompt is shown if, after pressing enter, you have left unclosed shell
# constructs in your command line, for example, a string without a terminating
# quote or a `for` loop without the final `done`.
