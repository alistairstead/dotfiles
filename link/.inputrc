# .inputrc: initialization file for readline
#
# for more information on how this file works, please see the
# initialization file section of the readline(3) man page
#
# quick dirty little note:
#  to get the key sequence for binding, you can abuse bash.
#  while running bash, hit ctrl+v, and then type the key sequence.
#  so, typing 'alt + left arrow' in konsole gets you back:
#    ^[[1;3D
#  the readline entry to make this skip back a word will then be:
#    "\e[1;3D" backward-word
#

# do not bell on tab-completion
set bell-style none

# 8bit settings
set meta-flag on
set input-meta on
set convert-meta off
set output-meta on

# append a slash to completed names which are symbolic links to directories
set mark-symlinked-directories on
