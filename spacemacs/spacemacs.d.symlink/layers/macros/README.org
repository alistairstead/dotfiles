#+TITLE: Macros Layer

* Description

Macros layer serves as a base layer that all other personal packages declare
dependence on in their respective ~layers.el~.

Common packages and utilities are defined here.

** Macros and Functions

- ~with-face~ :: Shorthand for ~propertize s 'face '(props)~
- ~xi~ :: Anonymous function macro. [[http://www.modernemacs.com/post/xi-macro/][See my blog post on it.]]
- ~with-dir~ :: Executes forms within a directory.
- ~evil-global-set-keys~ :: Improved to take possibly many states and
     keybindings.

** Packages

~dash-functional~ is the only included package at the moment. ~dash~ and ~s~ are
both loaded by default in Spacemacs but not the functional fork.
